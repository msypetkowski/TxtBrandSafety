\title{Text-based brand safety system - realization project}

\author{Mikołaj Ciesielski, Bartosz Paszko, Michał Sypetkowski}
\maketitle

\section{General information}

We are implementing a system
that provides brand safety functionality.

Tools and languages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python}\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/}}
        - the whole project will be written in python
    \item \textbf{pykka}\footnote{\url{https://www.pykka.org/en/latest/}}
        - for communication between services
\end{itemize}

In text processing system, we will use ready word embeddings
from a model trained on large dataset (eventually we will train the embeddings).


\section{Advertisement and website types}

We will manually define a fixed number of possible advertisement types.

Similarly, we will define fixed number of possible website types and 
For each website type we will consider using example
text fragments and extract specific embeddings
(e.g. weighed list of word embeddings).
These embeddings will be used for classifying websites.

TODO: how exactly website type will be
represented and how classyfying will be done (we want probabilities)

\section{Measuring advertisement compatibility}

Wi will manually define a cost matrix $C(x, y)$ of rows
of size equal to number of advertisement types.
Each column will correspond to the text document type.

We will perform discrimination for each advertisement type $x$
by thresholding the following sum:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{y\in{Y}} {C(t, y) * P(y)}
\end{equation}
where $P(y)$ is predicted probability of the text document being of type $y$.



\section{Services types}
We decided to distinguish 2 types of services.

\subsection{Main service}
This service will accept queries from client applications.
The query argument will be the website body (html code).
Services of this type will respond with list of decision for each advertisement type
(whether the advertisement of given type conflict with the given website).
The website code is passed to a text processing service.
The service will perform load balancing by employing proper text processing services
(e.g. by random choice).


\subsection{Text extraction and processing service}
A website will be represented by it's whole html code.
This service will obtain raw text fragments from it.
This service will answer queries by returning vector of length of advertisement types.
The vector will contain probabilities whether placing an advertisement of given type
on the website (that query is about) is appriopriate.

We are planning to use GPU acceration for faster text processing.
